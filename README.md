this is a project i thought about, i started making plugins using this plugin for minecraft called skript, it can be found here: https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript i really liked the syntax and found that alot of people found it easy to use, so I set a goal for myself to make a program that allows you to use a custom skript-like syntax to make lua code, skript's syntax is designed to be as close to english as possible.

any pull requests or suggestions will be greatly apprecieated, so far i only have the part made to generate part of the syntax tree, i will be working on this part mainly then I will be making the interpreter in lua that allows you to run the tree!
